## Extra Advanced Tasks

### Easier

- [ ] Patch: Edit an review body
- [ ] Patch: Edit a comment body
- [ ] Patch: Edit a user's information
- [ ] Get: Search for an review by title
- [ ] Post: add a new user

### Harder

- [ ] Protect your endpoints with JWT authorization. We have notes on this that will help a bit, _but it will make building the front end of your site a little bit more difficult_
- [ ] Get: Add functionality to get reviews created in last 10 minutes
- [ ] Get: Get all reviews that have been liked by a user. This will require an additional junction table.
- [ ] Research and implement online image storage or random generation of images for categories

## FEEDBACK

### ESSENTIAL PATCH `/api/reviews/1`

> If the body is missing in the PATCH request (i.e. no votes_inc), the server should STILL send back the review with the comment count not updated and a response of 200 rather than 400: Bad request.

### ESSENTIAL GET `/api/reviews/1/comments`

> Slightly confusing... This should return a 200 when the article exists, whether or not there are any comments. It should simply return an empty array. No comments isn't an error!

### ESSENTIAL POST `/api/reviews/1/comments`

> You tested for an invalid username AND and invalid body in the same test! An incorrect username should return a 404: Not Found _OR_ 422: Unprocessable Entity status code when `POST` contains a valid username that does not exist.
